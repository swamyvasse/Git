Source code management / version control system
-----------------------------------------------
1. you should not store coding in laptop/desktop
2. you should store in repos for safety/security
3. version control, you can go back to previous versions 
4. branches ---> master is always PRODUCTION
     create a branch from master ---> edit the changes ----> raise a PULL REQUEST --> every team member can review the changes ---> if good then approve and merge those
     changes 
5. you can track who is doing what 
we have multiple vendors 
git hub
git lab 
bit 
repository ---> stores somthing ---> store the code

Github
-------------------------
1. create repo 
2. clone into laptop 

1. what is difference b/w centralized and decentralized?
